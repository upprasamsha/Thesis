        <p class="captions1">Replacing clothes instead of repairing them has a significant negative impact on the environment, as the fashion industry is a major source of pollution. It contributes around 10% of global carbon emissions—more than international flights and shipping combined. Additionally, the industry consumes vast amounts of water, with about 2,700 liters needed to produce just one cotton t-shirt. Each year, 92 million tons of textile waste ends up in landfills, and 500,000 tons of microfibers from synthetic clothing pollute our oceans.

        </p>
        <p class="captions2">Repairing your clothes instead of discarding them not only reduces waste and pollution but also saves you money. Simple repairs are often inexpensive and can extend the life of your garments. By making this small change, you can help reduce the environmental impact of the textile industry and contribute to a more sustainable future. Let’s shift our mindset—repairing is better for the planet and your wallet!
